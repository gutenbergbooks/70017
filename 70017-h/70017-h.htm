<p>1. Once upon a time Uncle Wiggily met Baby Bunty on her skates.
“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” laughed the little rabbit girl, “why don’t you get
a pair and come roller skating with me?” The bunny sort of twinkled
his pink nose doubtful like. “Do you think an old rabbit like me could
skate?” he asked. “Of course you could! I’ll teach you if you’ve
forgotten!” kindly offered Baby Bunty. “All right,” said Mr. Longears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="05" style="max-width: 77.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/05.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>2. Uncle Wiggily, in his heart, felt that something dreadful would
happen. But he did not like to disappoint Baby Bunty, so he bought
himself a pair of roller skates and began. “This is how you do it!”
called back the cute little rabbit girl, as she started boldly off, for she
was a good skater. “Ye-ye-yes, my de-de-dear! I—I see how you
do it,” stammered Uncle Wiggily. “But it isn’t so-so-so easy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="06" style="max-width: 78.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/06.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>3. All went well for a while, though Uncle Wiggily, of course, could
not skate as fast as Baby Bunty. All of a sudden one of the bunny’s
paws shot out from under him. “Oh, Baby Bunty! Look!” he cried.
“Uncle Wiggily! Stop that!” scolded Bunty. “You shouldn’t try any
fancy tricks before you learn to skate straight!” Mr. Longears
twinkled his nose. “Trick!” he cried. “I couldn’t help doing this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp94" id="07" style="max-width: 79em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/07.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>4. After some hard work Uncle Wiggily managed to get his elevated
leg back on the ground where it belonged, and he started off once
more. But he tried to go too fast and, all of a sudden he turned a
peppersault in the air. “Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Why do you keep on
doing those tricks?” cried Baby Bunty. “I—I’m not doing them on
purpose!” said the poor bunny. “They just—just—seem to happen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="08" style="max-width: 78.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/08.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>5. Well, after a while, Uncle Wiggily landed right side up with care,
and he and Baby Bunty skated off once more. But, all of a sudden,
they reached the top of a hill, and, before he knew what was going on,
Uncle Wiggily started to glide down. “Oh! Oh!” he cried. “Look
out!” shouted Baby Bunty. “See the puddle!” “I see it!” shouted
Uncle Wiggily, “and I don’t like the looks of it, either! Wow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp94" id="09" style="max-width: 78.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/09.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>6. Nearer and nearer rolled the bunny gentleman to the puddle.
Just as he seemed about to plop in, he gave a great jump, as Jack did
over the candle stick, and right across sailed Uncle Wiggily. “Good!
Good!” cried Baby Bunty, who caught hold of a tree to save herself
from skating into the water. “That was good, Uncle Wiggily!”
“It was not so bad for an old chap!” chuckled the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp94" id="10" style="max-width: 79.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/10.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>7. Down came Uncle Wiggily, “ker-plunk!” on the far side of the
mud puddle. He thought everything was going to be fine, and that
now he could skate with Baby Bunty. But, all of a sudden, his legs
began to spread apart, farther and farther. “Oh! Oh! Oh!!” he cried.
Baby Bunty, who had skated around the puddle, came hurrying up.
“Oh, what is the matter now?” asked Baby Bunty. It was dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp94" id="11" style="max-width: 78.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/11.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>8. “Wait a minute! I’ll help you, Uncle Wiggily!” called Baby
Bunty. She began to push on one of the spread-apart legs of the
bunny. “You pull on your other leg, Uncle Wiggily,” advised Baby
Bunty. The rabbit tried, but it was no use. “Oh, if we only had some
one to help!” he sighed. “I’ll help you!” offered a voice. “Who was
that?” asked Baby Bunty. “Oh, the Alligator!” cried Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="12" style="max-width: 78.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/12.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>9. All of a sudden, as soon as he knew the Alligator was there,
Uncle Wiggily’s legs seemed to pull together. “I’m all right now,
Bunty!” he cried. “Come on, I’ll skate as I haven’t skated since I was
a boy rabbit!” And Mr. Longears did just that. He and Baby Bunty
glided so fast that, run as he did, the Skillery Scallery Alligator could
not get them. “Ha! Ha!” laughed the bunny, “who says I can’t skate!”</p>

</figure>

<p>1. Once upon a time Uncle Wiggily was out walking wearing his
tall silk hat, for he had been to a reception given by Mrs. Twistytail,
the pig lady. Then, all of a sudden, when Uncle Wiggily was nearly
at his hollow stump bungalow, the Fox threw a snowball, knocking off
the hat. “Ha! Ha!” laughed the Wolf. “That’s funny!” Uncle Wiggily
could see nothing very funny about it. “Guess I’ll run,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="15" style="max-width: 77.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/15.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>2. Uncle Wiggily guessed what sort of a trick the Fox and Wolf were
trying to play on him. “They thought I’d stop and pick up my hat,”
said the bunny to himself, “and then they could catch me and nibble
my ears. But I’d rather lose my hat than my ears!” So away he ran
without his hat. Out jumped the Fox and Wolf. One of them picked
up the hat and chased after Uncle Wiggily with it, crying: “Wait!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="16" style="max-width: 78.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/16.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>3. Uncle Wiggily ran so fast without his hat that soon he left the
Fox and Wolf behind. “Well, our trick didn’t work,” said the Fox.
“No,” agreed the Wolf, “but I know another trick we can play.” The
Fox wanted to know what it was. “We’ll do this,” growled the Wolf.
“We’ll sneak up and leave Uncle Wiggily’s hat near his bungalow.
Then we’ll hide, and when he comes out to get it, we’ll grab him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp94" id="17" style="max-width: 78.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/17.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>4. Uncle Wiggily ran on as fast as he could, without his hat, until
he reached his hollow stump bungalow. Near it he saw some of the
animal boys having a snowball fight. “Oh, this gives me an idea
for playing a trick on the Fox and Wolf,” said the bunny. Just then
up rushed Floppy Twistytail, the piggie boy. He had heard what the
Fox and Wolf said about coming to the bungalow and Floppy told all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="18" style="max-width: 77.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/18.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>5. “You say the Fox and Wolf are coming to put my hat on the
ground near my bungalow, and will grab me when I go to get it; is that
it, Floppy?” asked the bunny. “That’s it,” said the piggie boy. “Ah,
now for a snowball fight!” cried Uncle Wiggily to the animal boys.
“Make all the hard balls you can,” he told them. “Hide around the
corner of my bungalow, and we’ll wait for the Fox and Wolf to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="19" style="max-width: 77.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/19.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>6. Along came the Fox and Wolf, not knowing what was going to
happen to them. Around the corner of the bungalow Uncle Wiggily
and the animal boys watched. “We’ll leave the hat on the snow,” said
the Fox to the Wolf. “I guess Uncle Wiggily is in there now. Then
we’ll hide behind the stump and wait for him to come out to get his
hat.” The Wolf said that would be a good plan, so that’s what they did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="20" style="max-width: 77.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/20.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>7. “Now, boys, be on the watch!” whispered Uncle Wiggily to the
animal chaps with their hard snowballs. “I’m going out now to get my
hat. When the Fox and Wolf rush at me—well, you know what to
do!” The animal boys chuckled with glee. “Yes, we know what to do,
all right, Uncle Wiggily!” His pink nose twinkling at what was
going to happen, Uncle Wiggily stepped bravely toward his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="21" style="max-width: 77.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/21.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>8. All of a sudden, just as Uncle Wiggily reached down and picked
up his hat—all of a sudden, out rushed the Fox and Wolf from behind
the stump. “Now we’ll get him!” howled the Wolf. “Let them have
the snowballs, fellows!” cried the piggie boy. And they threw the hard
chunks of snow and ice in the faces of the Fox and Wolf. “Oh wow!
What is this?” barked the Fox as he felt a snowball hit him on his ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="22" style="max-width: 77.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/22.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>9. “Give it to them, boys! Give it to them!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
The bunny rabbit put his hat down over his ears so it wouldn’t fall
off and then he, too, joined in the snowball fight. “I thought you said
we could easily get Uncle Wiggily!” howled the Wolf to the Fox.
“Well, I thought we could!” cried the Fox. “Oh, wow, but what a
mistake we made. Never again will I throw at Uncle Wiggily’s hat!”</p>

UNCLE WIGGILY TOOK THE SCARECROW,<br>
JUST TO PLAY A LITTLE TRICK. THE BAD OLD<br>

<p>1. One day, when Uncle Wiggily was hopping around, looking for
an adventure, he reached a cornfield where, all summer, had stood an
old Scarecrow. “Hum!” said the bunny to himself, as he saw the old
stuffed, ragged man. “The farmer has no further use for this Scarecrow.
His corn is cut and the crows have flown south. I’ll take the
Scarecrow home and play a little trick on Nurse Jane with it. Ha! Ha!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="25" style="max-width: 77.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/25.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>2. Uncle Wiggily laughed to himself as he thought of the trick he
would play on Nurse Jane with the Scarecrow. “I guess I’ll put it away
and save it for Hallowe’en and play the trick then,” said the bunny to
himself. He became tired of hauling the stuffed and ragged man, and
stood the Scarecrow up near a log, while he sat down on the other side
of the log. Then the Fuzzy Fox saw the Scarecrow and wanted it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="26" style="max-width: 77.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/26.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>3. All of a sudden, as Uncle Wiggily was thinking of hopping on
again, up ran the Fox. “Ho! Ho!” barked the Fox, as he saw the
Scarecrow, “these old clothes are just what I want for the winter!”
Then the Fox started to run away with Uncle Wiggily’s Scarecrow that
the bunny wanted for Hallowe’en. “Here! Come back!” cried the
bunny, jumping up on the log. But the Old Fox only ran the faster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="27" style="max-width: 77em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/27.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>4. “Well, if the Fox took one Scarecrow away from me I must find
another,” said Uncle Wiggily, with a twinkle of his pink nose. He
hopped along a little farther, and in a fence corner he saw a second
ragged and stuffed man. “He has a tall silk hat on—like I wear!” said
the bunny. “Some might take him for me. And what’s this—powder
and matches! A hunter must have left them here. Now for a trick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="28" style="max-width: 76.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/28.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>5. “I’ll play a joke on the Fox or Wolf if they try to take this Scarecrow
away from me,” said Uncle Wiggily with a laugh. Then the
bunny poured some powder from the hunter’s flask inside the second
Scarecrow. “I’ll put in a Fourth of July fuse, such as firecrackers
have,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll hide and watch, and when the Fox or
Wolf runs away with this Scarecrow—Zoopie! What will happen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="29" style="max-width: 77.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/29.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>6. After Uncle Wiggily had put powder inside the Scarecrow, making
the stuffed man into a sort of torpedo bomb, the bunny carried the
image near a big rock. “I’ll lie down around the corner of the rock
and make believe I’m asleep,” thought the rabbit. “But I’ll have one
eye open and as soon as any bad animal takes my Scarecrow I’ll strike
a match, light the powder fuse and then—Whoop! Up they’ll go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp91" id="30" style="max-width: 76.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/30.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>7. From afar the Woozie Wolf had seen Uncle Wiggily’s second
Scarecrow, but the Wolf didn’t know about the powder. “Oh ho!”
snickered the Wolf, creeping closer to the Scarecrow, “the Fuzzy Fox
thought he was smart, taking away a Scarecrow to get the old clothes
to keep him warm this winter. Well, he isn’t the only one! I’ll carry
this stuffed man off to my den and take his clothes for myself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="31" style="max-width: 77.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/31.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>8. All of a sudden, almost before Uncle Wiggily knew what was happening,
the Wolf made a jump and grabbed the Scarecrow. “You’re
mine!” he howled. But the bunny gentleman quickly struck a match
and lighted the powder fuse. It began to smoke and sizzle. Away ran
the Wolf with the Scarecrow! “Oh ho!” laughed Uncle Wiggily,
“He won’t run so fast in a few minutes! Oh, listen for the noise!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="32" style="max-width: 76.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/32.jpg" alt="figure">
</figure>

<p>9. All of a sudden there was a loud banging noise. “There it goes!”
cried the bunny gentleman. “There goes the powder!” And the Scarecrow
the Wolf was carrying away was blown up. Uncle Wiggily was
far enough off not to be hurt. But that Wolf—“Oh, Skuzzie-zuzzie!”
he howled, as he felt himself coming down like a skyrocket stick, after
having sailed up, “Oh, zoopie! Lightning must have struck me!”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
